# 🖌️ Studio Landing Page – CSS Brainstorm Project

# Description 

This project is a custom Studio Landing Page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a fictional creative studio, with sections describing their purpose, product offerings, client testimonials, and a subscription box for users to join the newsletter. The layout also features a footer for contact and links.

# ✨ Design Purpose
This layout was inspired by a community Figma design, which I adapted into code to sharpen my CSS skills. My goal was to explore how far I could go using only CSS for shapes and layout creativity — all without relying on images or SVGs.

# 🧠 Development Highlights

- 💡 Shape creation purely with CSS — no SVGs or images
- 📄 Static layout built with semantic HTML
- 📬 Newsletter form (not hooked to backend)
- ⚠️ Note: This page is currently non-responsive and built with vanilla code, future versions may use React for improved scalability
